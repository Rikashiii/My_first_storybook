# Story
The storybook "Rikashi's New Apartment" is about a young man named Rikashi who moves into his own apartment for the first time. The story follows his journey as he learns to navigate the challenges of adulthood, from doing laundry and cooking to managing his finances and dealing with homesickness. Along the way, he makes a new friend, Kenji, who helps him realize that it's okay to ask for help and that learning is a part of growing up. The story ends with Rikashi feeling a sense of pride and accomplishment as he settles into his new life, realizing that he is capable of being independent.
